TODO:
do the export_data script
Fix the delay in color picking in chart data api 
Prevent sending data if the challenge has finished,
Do the CRON scripts

IMPORTANT: add checks for inputs, I often only used direct output of FILTER_VALDATE_INT, but I sould also check the int are positive !
Same thing with dates, i did not check they were too far or in the past / etc
IMPORTANT: do all error messages, because right now nothing happens on error
IMPORTANT: investigate the graph on index defi and the table in defi not showing the same data... FOUND : I think the order of data in defi is wrong. Verre is ordure for example

Improvement: refill form with sent data when there was an error
Improvement: autoresize pictures for ateliers/workshops
